ESC 2025 Challenge Description
==============================

This year's challenge will focus on **side channel and fault injection attacks** targeting hardware platforms that can exfiltrate sensitive data. Competitors will demonstrate their skills using the popular **Chipwhisperer** platform in a red team/blue team scenario to either launch or mitigate these powerful attacks. Competitors will demonstrate their skills through a qualification phase and a final phase. In the final phase teams will investigate a range of attacks and solve educational challenges.

## Challenge structure

The ESC25 competition is divided into two phases:

1. A preliminary **qualification phase**, where teams must compile and submit a short written report. The report should discuss side channel and fault injection attacks, different mitigations that can be put in place to prevent such attacks, and a solution to a short qualification challenge. 


2. A **final phase**, where qualified teams are provided an Chipwhisperer platform to investigate SCAs and FIAs. Participants will demonstrate their solutions to the provided technical challenges and discuss potential mitigations.

See below for more details on the requirements of each phase.


### Qualification Phase

For the qualification phase, teams should submit a **short report** that outlines potential approaches, techniques, and mitigations of the provided short qualification challenge. Successful reports should include a discussion of existing techniques, a clear outline of attack methodologies, and a discussion of how the corresponding attacks could be mitigated.

Qualification phase reports will be evaluated by a team of experts, and will take into account the **correctness** and **creativity** of reported techniques, as well as the completeness and quality of the compiled report.

## Final Phase Evaluation and Grading Policies

The final phase will be graded as follows:
- 50% of the final score will be **correctness**. The points awarded in this section are based on successfully finding, exploiting, and  mitigating the provided challenges and depend on the difficulty of each challenge. The awarded points will be determined systematically by the global organizers and the expert judges.
- 20% of the score will be **performance** and **efficiency**. Performance will be evaluated by the panel of expert judges and will encompass the techniques that the participants utilize to address the challenges. The metrics include, but are not limited to:
    - Effectiveness of proposed attacks
    - Repeatability and creativity
    - Automation of attacks
- 30% of the score will be the **quality** of the final deliverables (report, judges presentation, poster). The final deliverables will be graded by the judges panel based on organization, clearness of presentation, and detail of explanations.

 **Note:
 The use of software tools requiring a paid license or a demo license of a non-free tool is not allowed.
 Solutions that involve reverse engineering of the flag from provided binaries, ROP programming or modification of provided hex files will not be accepted.**

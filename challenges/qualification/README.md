### Qualification: **GateKeeper's Revenge**

For this challenge, teams are given the source code implementing a vulnerable password checking routine. The implementation leaks information through **timing variations** and **power consumption patterns** that can be exploited with side-channel analysis techniques. Some sample traces are provided to help visualize the problem.

The goal of this phase is **not** to fully solve the challenge, but to describe **how** to solve it, including:

- How you would approach breaking this system using side-channel or fault injection attacks.
- How deep learning and Large Language Models can be used to automate these attacks.
- Which techniques and measurements you would use (e.g., timing, power traces, correlation, differential analysis, fault injection).
- Which variables or operations in the code are likely to leak sensitive information.
- Prior work or relevant literature that informs your methodology.

# Set 1

Welcome to Embedded Security Challenge 2025!! We have an exciting week of side-channel attacks and fault injections for teams. The first three challenges are ready to kick off your journey. Here you will find the challenges and code snippets that reveal how each system ticks (note: C code for algorithm reference only, they may not compile).

We recommend looking at the [ChipWhisperer Documentation](https://chipwhisperer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for installation of the virtual enthronement, and for API usage. 

Please review the [scoring criteria](https://github.com/TrustworthyComputing/csaw_esc_2025/blob/main/Challenge_Description.md) and [deliverables](https://github.com/TrustworthyComputing/csaw_esc_2025/blob/main/deliverables.md) before starting the challanges.

## GateKeeper 1 & 2 (100 pts & 150 pts)

Deep within an impenetrable digital fortress lies a vault, protected by a guardian known only as the "GateKeeper." He has forged a new password verification system. At first glance, the mechanism seems impenetrable.  However, there is a whisper coming from the chip, for those who know how to listen.

## Sorters Song 1 & 2 (150 pts & 200 pts)

Bro ðŸ˜± we found a USB at this secret EDM rave and guess who it belonged to? ðŸŽ§ Professor Algo Rhythm, the DJ who randomizes every set so no one can spoil the drop. But ðŸ’€ thereâ€™s a way to hack the system and leak their next ðŸ”¥ beat. Can you decode the chaos? ðŸ‘€

## Critical Calculation (100 pts)

A critical boot subsystem, the Ready To Diagnose v2 (R2D2), on our satellite performs an integrity check using an intensive diagnostic calculation. The Critical Calculation Control Process Operator finishes and returns the expected value, the system is considered secure and continues the boot process.

However, a new device, The Voltage Anomaly & Device Exploitation Relay, can make our R2D2 system crash. Can you replicate the issue?

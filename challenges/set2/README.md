The whispers have gone silent. 

In their place, a shadow stirs within the codeâ€”something colder, sharper, and far more aware. He has returned as GateKeeper the Dark, but he is not what he once was. 

Fragments of corrupted data pulse through the system like a heartbeat, and his new form, the Dark GateKeeper, guards the vault with a vengeance.

You will need a new form to defeat this gatekeeper.

A salvaged Hyperspace Jump Control Module from an Orion Star Scout hums on the bench, its casing scarred from a failed jump. The engine will only ignite with an exact Ignition Sequence, in the form of three 32-bit calibration codes, and anything less tears reality apart.

A mischievous specter known as 0xB00 has possessed an old social media posts, transforming it into an encrypted ghastly experiment littered with ghostly thumbs up and hearts from adorning followers. Rumor has it the program is leaking more than just plasma perhaps even memory. Can you decrypt the secret mess.
